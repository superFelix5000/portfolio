# Portfolio

A small portfolio/link website project.

## built with fresh

Trying out the new full stack framework [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) by the
[Deno](https://deno.land/) team. Jumping on the hype train with islands
architecture and full stack type safety. Really enjoying the developer
experience so far.

### Look at it

You can see the app (which I have deployed using
[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)) -->
[here](https://superfelix5000.deno.dev/)

### Todo
- the twind plugin seems to be a bit buggy so the text decoration colors don't work, hence the ugly inline styling
- ...

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```
