# Portfolio

A small portfolio/link website project.

## built with fresh

Trying out the new full stack framework [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) by the
[Deno](https://deno.land/) team. Jumping on the hype train with islands
architecture and full stack type safety. Really enjoying the developer
experience so far.
